# Machine Component Design Optimization

Design projects for Boğaziçi University's **Machine Design II** (ME 424) class.

### Project 1: Gearing Design

Designing a planetary gear that will transmit the maximum amount of power with the given specifications and constraints. The design requires a bending safety factor at least 1.5 and a surface safety factor of at least 1.2 with 99 % reliability. Safe use of $1\times 10^{8}$ revolutions of the arm is required.

### Project 2: Bolted Joint Design

Designing a bolted joint such that the lowest of the safety factors for the possible failure modes is above 1.6 and the cost is minimum.

### Project 3: Spring Design

Designing a spring that has lowest cost and safe against fatigue and buckling failures with an infinite fatigue life.

**The governing equation:**

$$\frac{\partial^2 u(x,t)}{\partial x^2} = \frac{1}{\beta^2}\frac{\partial^2 u(x,t)}{\partial t^2}$$

**Axial force in the spring:**

$$F(x,t) = Lk\frac{\partial u(x,t)}{\partial x}$$

where $u$ is the displacement in the $x$ direction, $L$ is the length of the spring, $k$ is the spring rate, $m$ is the total mass of the spring, $\beta^2 = L^2k/m$
